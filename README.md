# Wish.com Summer Clothes Sales Performance Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of summer clothes sales performance on Wish.com. The project aims to dive deep into the sales data, revealing consumer preferences, pricing strategies, and the effectiveness of marketing efforts. The goal is to provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to enhance sales growth and customer satisfaction in the competitive e-commerce landscape.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to identify patterns, understand the impact of various factors on sales, and propose strategies to amplify sales success on Wish.com.

## Methodology

The analysis is conducted using Power BI for robust data visualization. We dissect sales trends, price sensitivity, consumer ratings, and promotional impacts. The report leverages a dataset containing detailed information about product listings, ratings, and sales performance on Wish.com. Data cleaning and manipulation were performed to ensure the quality and reliability of the insights derived.

## Key Findings

1. **Retail Expansion Opportunities**: Women’s apparel leads sales, indicating a focused market strategy with high consumer demand. There is significant scope for expansion into men’s and other product categories.
2. **Leveraging Summer Essentials**: Essentials like shorts, bikinis, and tanks are currently underrepresented and present a prime opportunity for targeted marketing.
3. **Advertisement Utilization as a Revenue Booster**: Despite the effectiveness of ad boosts, over half of the merchants are not leveraging this strategy.
4. **Global Apparel Insights**: The dominance of products from China and the global reach of certain products like bikinis suggest strategic opportunities for product placement and expansion.

## Insights and Recommendations

- **Strategic Dominance in Women's Apparel**: Continue leveraging the strong position in women's apparel while exploring the untapped potential of men's and other markets.
- **Leveraging Summer Essentials**: Increase the listing and promotion of summer essentials to boost sales during the peak season.
- **Ad Boosts' Potential**: Encourage more merchants to utilize ad boosts to increase visibility and sales.
- **Diverse Shipping Options**: While standard shipping is preferred, exploring and promoting express shipping options may uncover new customer segments.
